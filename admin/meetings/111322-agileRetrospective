## Agenda
- Agile Review

## Retrospective for sprint

### Radar 1
- More defined work clarity
- Autonomy pretty good
- Mastery: starter code has some style issue
- Impact: Better communication
- Engagement: we are cutting down feature, discuss adding feature to boost engagement

### Radar 2
- Testing: unit test need to appear earlier, after a while the tests are better. Need to first finish feature before write test, can have separate channel to discuss
- Shared coding standards: merges, use normal merge instead of squash merge. Global variable should be upper case
- Technical Debt: fairly well, Ben and Yong managing/modifying pushed code. Function header could be better. Can do a physical meeting reviewing code.

### Specific situations(like, dislike, high points): 
- Communication issue: group coding section; keep info on slack for people to refer to; organize team meetings, end up bringing specific issues and other people free. First separate teams and then discuss.
- Contribution: related to communication, might need to find ways to assign jobs.
- Publish branch/use git issue: that is requirement, open issue first, can edit later, facilitate other peopleâ€™s understanding. When try to develop features, need to separate different work in different branches. 
- Technical: git using, html source, group come together to make work clear

### Overall comment:
Do retro maybe in person next time
