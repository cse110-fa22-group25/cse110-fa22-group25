## Retrospective for sprint

### Problem from last time:
1. Lack of communication between larger team and subteams. Better? Worse?
- Slack channel useful for communication, more involved.
- Agreed, clear on what to do
- Effective communication collaboration

2. Equal contribution
- This time plan out thoroughly, easy to figure out what need to be done

3. Not aware on howâ€™s things been going
- Technical stuff are better because talked in group
- Labs help for puppeteer, discussion on slack

### Specific situations(like, dislike, high points): 
- General progress/results good: 
- Better communication than last time:
- More can get done: contribution difference among members, would want more test but might be because thanksgiving. Better overall than last time, three version of add test. When doing e2e end unit testing all feature, multiple tests going around. Minor confusion in separation into unit and e2e tests (features).
- Push work to public branch:


### Overall comment:
Finish by Wednesday: code coverage pretty good and css

Problems to be solved: text overflow bug; css/style; E2E tests


## Next Meeting

- TA meeting, 6 P.M. after class, Monday
