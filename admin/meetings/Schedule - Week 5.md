# Schedule - Week 5

# Team Workflow

- We should have two group meetings every week, one on Wednesday and one on the weekends (better on Saturday, in case you did not finish the weekly assignment, you still have time to do it).
- During every meeting on Weekends, we should discuss the team schedule for the next week. Two leaders should look ahead to the team assignments and assign the tasks to different members in the meeting.
- After getting their tasks, team members can start working on those tasks.
- On Wednesday’s meeting, every member should first talk about the progress they have made or any problems they have encountered, or any support they need. If there are any difficulties, we can discuss the possible solutions together. At this point, you do not need to finish your weekly task. The important thing is that after this meeting, you should be confident that you can finish your tasks on time (before Sunday).
- On Saturday’s meeting, the workflow is the same, but at this point, you should finish your weekly tasks. This means we should also report our progress on the individual tasks and everyone should give their opinions, suggestions, or possible problems. Then if there is anything we need to discuss, we should continue to discuss them. Finally, we should look ahead to the next week’s assignments and team leaders should assign tasks to the team members.
- **Everyone should provide their phone number on their slack profile.**
- For the daily standup, you should briefly introduce the work you have done yesterday and the work you plan to do today. Most importantly, ask for help if you need any support from others.

# Tasks for all members

- Read the book Shape Up (Part 1, chapters 1 - 6). Pay attention to the examples and Chapter 6
- Learn how to use the frameworks if you are not familiar with the workflow.
    - My personal recommendation for the frameworks are:
        - Frontend: React, Bootstrap/**Chakra**/Material
        - Backend: Express
        - Database: Non relational database (MongoDB, etc.)
