# Decide the features will be implemented in the second sprint

## Context and Problem Statement

Which features will be implemented in the second sprint?

## Considered Options

* Adding more features such as maintenance page.
* Stick with current features and only implement the unfinished features (search, multi-filtering), focusing on unit testing, E2E testing, and debugging.

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: "Stick with current features...", because we only have limited time for the project and a correct development process is more important than implementing more features.
