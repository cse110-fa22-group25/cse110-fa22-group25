# Feature retraction

## Context

While planning the Project timeline and advice from our TA, the number of features were brouhgt to scrutiny. 

## Decision

After creating a feature priority list based on the features neccesary to our product. With the list we made as guidance, the decision was made to cut a number of features from the product.

## Consequences

We belive that implementation will become easier to organized and more streamlined as focus can be placed on the features that are neccesary to make a functional product.
