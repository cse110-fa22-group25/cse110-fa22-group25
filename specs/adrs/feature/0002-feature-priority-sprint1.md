# Decide the features will be implemented in the first sprint

## Context and Problem Statement

Which features will be implemented in the first sprint?

## Considered Options

1. Main page: add a new product, view existing products
2. Product Page: create/read profiles with the required information
3. Product Page: delete product profiles
4. Product Page/Malfunction page: update profiles with optional information
    1. information not required when first creating the profile
5. Product Page/Malfunction page: read/add/update notes to the product profiles
    1. fault records — past breakdowns, how things were fixed, etc
6. Main Page: filtering products by custom filters
    1. bare minimum → implement one-label selection
    2. no searching for the label → just filtering
    3. start with pre-set filters
7. Maintenance Page: read/update/create/delete maintenance events with frequencies
    1. bare minimum → frequencies would not be applied directly to the dates
8. Maintenance Page: read/add/update specifications for maintenance events
9. Maintenance Page/Main Page: a list view of maintenance dates
    1. bare minimum → display as they are entered, rather than by date
10. Maintenance Page: include content recommendations for certain products
11. Main Page: settings like user-name, password, etc
    1. making the application accessible from multiple devices with the sign-in?z

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: the first six features, because they are the backbone of the product and should be first completed.
