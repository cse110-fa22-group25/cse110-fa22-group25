# Place event card component with the same level of profile cards

## Context and Problem Statement

Where to put the card component of the upcoming event? 

Should the content of upcoming events change with tag filtering?

## Considered Options

* Put the card beside the profile cards
* Place it in a separate area from the product cards
* Use a dropdown menu for the event card
* The content should not change with different tag filtering
* The content should change based on tag filtering

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: "Put the card besides the profile cards", because the UI looks better than using other options
Chosen option: "The content should change based on tag filtering", because using tag filter means user want to find some specific profiles, and the upcoming event should also display the information for those profiles.
