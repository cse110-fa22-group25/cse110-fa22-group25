# Local Storage

## Context

To store user-created information for our product, a method to permanently and temporarily store user data had to be devised. 

## Decision

Local storage was chosen to be the method of storage. Local storage was chosen as it would be more straightforward to implement and more of the team are familiar with using local storage vs learning a cloud storage API. 

## Consequences

With the increased familiarity and ease of learning the implemnetation of local storage compared to cloud storage, we believe that we will encounter fewer problems when implementing the product.
