# Project Topic

## Warranty Manager (Final Product Name TBD)

Project was selected by majority vote.  

Chosen over original idea of a Todo List because a todo list would require notifications, and that would require either that the tab always be open in the browser. The alternative would be to use Electron, which would take too long to learn.

Water tracking app idea would be creating another problem rather than solving one. 

Warranty tracker was chosen because it doesn't have the same drawbacks as the other ideas and seems relatively simple to implement from surface level perspective. (Top 10 famous last words)

### Goals:
- It's annoying to find the warranty information for a product when we need it after purchase, why not have a singular place where it's all stored?
- Users input product and purchase information at time of purchase, which can then all be retrieved if and when the user needs warranty information for something they purchased.
