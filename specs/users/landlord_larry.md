Landlord Larry has been managing his parents' properties since he dropped out of high school. He goes through a lot of appliances due to his large number of tenants. 

Since his tenants have a tendency to break anything he provides, he is constantly buting and RMA'ing appliances.

Larry doesn't really enjoy his job, and is constantly looking for ways to optimize and streamline his tasks so he can spend more time gaming in his bedroom.

## Demographics
- Age: 57
- Location: Bay Area, California
- Occupation: Landlord
- Hobbies: Gaming, not doing landlord stuff
- Larry considers himself computer literate and is able to learn and use new software easily. 
- He primarily uses a work desktop computer so he can separate his workspace from his gaming hobbies, 

## Challenges
- Larry has a difficult time keeping track of the appliances he needs to manage for his tenants. 
- Every time Larry needs to RMA an dish washer or washing machine (or any other appliance), he needs to check his notebook to find where he purchased the unit, and find the receipt and warranty information in his unorganized cabinet. 
    - Many of his tenants have complained about how slow it takes for him to respond to maintenance requests, and he needs to speed this process up before his tenants begin considering cancelling their lease to another cheaper apartment complex since they haven't had a working washing machine for 2 months. 

## Needs
 - Larry needs an app that will allow him to quickly look up the warranty information for large quantities of appliances, and be able to view and manage the RMA histories of each product.
